Sure, let's consider the player is facing "upwards",
or north (This is arbitrary since the direction can be relative based on how
you decide to map the 2D plane to the screen). The diagram below illustrates this concept:

```
     North (Player's Forward Direction)
             |
             |
             |
 West <---- Player ----> East
             |
             |
             |
          South
```

When a broadcast is sent, it is classified into eight different directions
based on the orientation of the sound source in relation to the player.
Here's an interpretation of these directions in terms of angles:

```
  \ 1 | 2 /
  8 \ | / 3
  ----P----     (P = Player)
  7 / | \ 4
  / 6 | 5 \
```

The numbering is counterclockwise with 1 being directly in front of the player.
The eight directions are calculated by dividing a 360° space into eight 45° sections.
These directions can be interpreted as follows:

1. North (0° <= θ < 45°)
2. North-East (45° <= θ < 90°)
3. East (90° <= θ < 135°)
4. South-East (135° <= θ < 180°)
5. South (180° <= θ < 225°)
6. South-West (225° <= θ < 270°)
7. West (270° <= θ < 315°)
8. North-West (315° <= θ < 360°)

Note: If the sound source is at the same position as the player, the direction is 0.

These directions are defined from the perspective of the player.
The θ is the angle between the player's forward direction (North in this case)
and the direction to the sound source, measured counterclockwise.
